# 💊 Machine Learning Pipeline for Warfarin Dose Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning pipeline** to predict the **therapeutic Warfarin dose** for patients. Warfarin is widely prescribed as an anticoagulant, but dosing is challenging due to **high inter-patient variability** and its **narrow therapeutic index**. Incorrect dosing can lead to severe bleeding or clotting events, making accurate dose prediction critical for patient safety.

To address this, we applied multiple supervised learning models to the **International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC)** dataset. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison, with the aim of identifying the most reliable model for dose prediction and supporting the personalization of anticoagulant therapy.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [PharmGKB – International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC)](https://www.pharmgkb.org/)  
- **Description:** The dataset contains patient-level demographic, clinical, and genetic information relevant to Warfarin dosing.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Demographics (e.g., age, weight, height, race/ethnicity)  
  - Clinical factors (e.g., target INR, enzyme inhibitors)  
  - Genetic variants (e.g., CYP2C9, VKORC1)

## 🤖 Models Implemented
We experimented with the following machine learning models:  

- 🔹 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- 🔹 **Random Forest Regressor (RF)**  
- 🔹 **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
- 🔹 **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)**  

Each model was trained and evaluated using a consistent preprocessing pipeline to ensure fair comparison.

## 📊 Model Performance
Evaluation was conducted using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and the **R² score**.  

| Model                          | MAE ↓   | MSE ↓   | R² Score ↑ |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  | 5.18    | 47.96   | 0.59       |
| **Random Forest (RF)**         | 4.82    | 41.87   | 0.64       |
| **Support Vector Regression**  | 5.49    | 51.44   | 0.55       |
| **Feed-Forward Neural Network**| **4.39**| **38.72**| **0.68**  |

✅ **Best Model:** The **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)** achieved the lowest error and highest R², showing the greatest potential for accurate Warfarin dose prediction.
